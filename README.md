## About the application

If I tell you to compare the words "teacher," "teacher," and "profession," you will, of course, tell me they are alike, but you will not know what criteria your reasoning used to compare them.

Thinking about this, I analyzed the reasoning criteria for such a comparison and created the Mochi Similarity Formula, which says that the classification of similarity between words can be given by the ratio of the sum of the equal characters of each word compared to another times two and the amount of characters of each word times the amount of words minus one.

Given two or more words (represented by vectors), the Mochi Similarity Formula returns the percentage rank of similarity between words, being 100% the maximum value of similarity, that is, the words processed are totally equal; and 0% the minimum value of similarity, that is, the words are totally different.
